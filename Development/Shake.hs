-- | This module is used for defining Shake build systems. As a simple example of a Shake build system,
--   let us build the file @result.tar@ from the files listed by @result.txt@:
--
-- @
--import "Development.Shake"
--import "Development.Shake.FilePath"
--
--main = 'shakeArgs' 'shakeOptions' $ do
--    'want' \"result.tar\"
--    \"*.tar\" '*>' \\out -> do
--        contents \<- 'readFileLines' $ out 'Development.Shake.FilePath.-<.>' \"txt\"
--        'need' contents
--        'cmd' \"tar -cf\" [out] contents
-- @
--
--   We start by importing the modules defining both Shake and routines for manipulating 'FilePath' values.
--   We define @main@ to call 'shake' with the default 'shakeOptions'. As the second argument to
--   'shake', we provide a set of rules. There are two common forms of rules, 'want' to specify target files,
--   and '*>' to define a rule which builds a 'FilePattern'. We use 'want' to require that after the build
--   completes the file @result.tar@ should be ready.
--
--   The @*.tar@ rule describes how to build files with the extension @.tar@, including @result.tar@.
--   We 'readFileLines' on @result.txt@, after changing the @.tar@ extension to @.txt@. We read each line
--   into the variable @contents@ -- being a list of the files that should go into @result.tar@. Next, we
--   depend ('need') all the files in @contents@. If any of these files change, the rule will be repeated.
--   Finally we call the @tar@ program. If either @result.txt@ changes, or any of the files listed by @result.txt@
--   change, then @result.tar@ will be rebuilt.

--   /== WRITING A BUILD SYSTEM ==============================/
--
--   When writing a Shake build system, start by defining what you 'want', then write rules
--   with '*>' to produce the results. Before calling 'cmd' you should ensure that any files the command
--   requires are demanded with calls to 'need'. We offer the following advice to Shake users:
--
-- * If @ghc --make@ or @cabal@ is capable of building your project, use that instead. Custom build systems are
--   necessary for many complex projects, but many projects are not complex.
--
-- * The 'shakeArgs' function automatically handles command line arguments. To define non-file targets use 'phony'.
--
-- * Put all result files in a distinguished directory, for example @_make@. You can implement a @clean@
--   command by removing that directory, using @'removeFilesAfter' \"_make\" [\"\/\/\*\"]@.
--
-- * To obtain parallel builds set 'shakeThreads' to a number greater than 1.
--
-- * Lots of compilers produce @.o@ files. To avoid overlapping rules, use @.c.o@ for C compilers,
--   @.hs.o@ for Haskell compilers etc.
--
-- * Do not be afraid to mix Shake rules, system commands and other Haskell libraries -- use each for what
--   it does best.
--
-- * The more accurate the dependencies are, the better. Use additional rules like 'doesFileExist' and
--   'getDirectoryFiles' to track information other than just the contents of files. For information in the environment
--   that you suspect will change regularly (perhaps @ghc@ version number), either write the information to
--   a file with 'alwaysRerun' and 'writeFileChanged', or use 'addOracle'.
--
--   /== GHC BUILD FLAGS ==============================/
--
--   For large build systems the choice of GHC flags can have a significant impact. We recommend:
--
-- > ghc --make MyBuildSystem -rtsopts -with-rtsopts=-I0
--
--   * @-rtsopts@: Allow the setting of further GHC options at runtime.
--
--   * @-I0@: Disable idle garbage collection. In a build system regularly running many system
--     commands the program appears \"idle\" very often, triggering regular unnecessary garbage collection, stealing
--     resources from the program doing actual work.
--
--   * Omit @-threaded@: In GHC 7.6 and earlier bug 7646 <http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7646>
--     can cause a race condition in build systems that write files then read them. Omitting @-threaded@ will
--     still allow your 'cmd' actions to run in parallel, so most build systems will still run in parallel.
--
--   * If you do compile with @-threaded@, pass the options @-qg -qb@ to @-with-rtsopts@
--     to disable parallel garbage collection. Parallel garbage collection in Shake
--     programs typically goes slower than sequential garbage collection, while occupying many cores that
--     could be used for running system commands.
