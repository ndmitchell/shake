-- | Lower-level primitives to drive Shake, which are wrapped into the
--   'Development.Shake.shake' function. Useful if you want to perform multiple Shake
--   runs in a row without reloading from the database.
--   Sometimes used in conjunction with @'shakeFiles'=\"\/dev\/null\"@.
--   Using these functions you can approximate the 'Development.Shake.shake' experience with:
--
-- @
-- shake opts rules = do
--     (_, after) \<- 'shakeWithDatabase' opts rules $ \\db -> do
--         'shakeOneShotDatabase' db
--         'shakeRunDatabase' db []
--     'shakeRunAfter' opts after
-- @

--   Some special considerations when using this function:
--
-- * The presence of an error does not mean the build will fail, specifically if a
--   previously required dependency was run and raised an error, then the thing that previously
--   required it will be run. If the build system has changed in an untracked manner,
--   the build may succeed this time round.
--
-- * If the previous run actually failed then 'shakeRunDatabase' will have thrown an exception.
--   You probably want to catch that exception so you can make the call to 'shakeErrorsDatabase'.
--
-- * You may see a single failure reported multiple times, with increasingly large call stacks, showing
--   the ways in which the error lead to further errors throughout.
--
-- * The 'SomeException' values are highly likely to be of type 'ShakeException'.
--
-- * If you want as many errors as possile in one run set @'shakeStaunch'=True@.
