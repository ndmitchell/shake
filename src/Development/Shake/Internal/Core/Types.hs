-- UNDERLYING DATA TYPE

-- | The 'Action' monad, use 'liftIO' to raise 'IO' actions into it, and 'Development.Shake.need' to execute files.
--   Action values are used by 'addUserRule' and 'action'. The 'Action' monad tracks the dependencies of a rule.
--   To raise an exception call 'error', 'fail' or @'liftIO' . 'throwIO'@.
newtype Action a = Action {fromAction :: RAW Global Local a}
    deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadIO, Typeable)

-- | How has a rule changed.
data RunChanged
    = ChangedNothing -- ^ Nothing has changed.
    | ChangedStore -- ^ The persisted value has changed, but in a way that should be considered identical.
    | ChangedRecomputeSame -- ^ I recomputed the value and it was the same.
    | ChangedRecomputeDiff -- ^ I recomputed the value and it was different.
      deriving (Eq,Show)

-- | The result of 'BuiltinRun'.
data RunResult value = RunResult
    {runChanged :: RunChanged
        -- ^ What has changed from the previous time.
    ,runStore :: BS.ByteString

-- | Define a rule between @key@ and @value@. A rule for a class of artifacts (e.g. /files/) provides:
--
-- * How to identify individual artifacts, given by the @key@ type, e.g. with file names.
--
-- * How to describe the state of an artifact, given by the @value@ type, e.g. the file modification time.
--
-- * How to persist the state of an artifact, using the 'ByteString' values, e.g. seralised @value@.
--
--   The arguments comprise the @key@, the value of the previous serialisation or 'Nothing' if the rule
--   has not been run previously, and 'True' to indicate the dependencies have changed or 'False' that
--   they have not.
type BuiltinRun key value = key -> Maybe BS.ByteString -> Bool -> Action (RunResult value)

-- | The action performed by @--lint@ for a given @key@/@value@ pair.
--   At the end of the build the lint action will be called for each @key@ that was built this run,
--   passing the @value@ it produced. Return 'Nothing' to indicate the value has not changed and
--   is acceptable, or 'Just' an error message to indicate failure.
--
--   For builtin rules where the value is expected to change use 'Development.Shake.Rules.noLint'.
type BuiltinLint key value = key -> value -> IO (Maybe String)

-- | A function that summarizes the current value into a short string, typically a hash.
--   The result should be stable, and should not depend on the state of the Shake database.
--   Used for rule memoization.
