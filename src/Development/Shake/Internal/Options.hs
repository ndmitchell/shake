-- | How should you determine if a file has changed, used by 'shakeChange'. The most common values are
--   'ChangeModtime' (the default, very fast, @touch@ causes files to rebuild) and 'ChangeModtimeAndDigestInput'

        -- ^ Compare equality of modification timestamps, a file has changed if its last modified time changes.
        --   A @touch@ will force a rebuild. This mode is fast and usually sufficiently accurate, so is the default.
    | ChangeDigest
        -- ^ Compare equality of file contents digests, a file has changed if its digest changes.
        --   A @touch@ will not force a rebuild. Use this mode if modification times on your file system are unreliable.
    | ChangeModtimeAndDigest
        -- ^ A file is rebuilt if both its modification time and digest have changed. For efficiency reasons, the modification
        --   time is checked first, and if that has changed, the digest is checked.
    | ChangeModtimeAndDigestInput
        -- ^ Use 'ChangeModtimeAndDigest' for input\/source files and 'ChangeModtime' for output files.
        --   An input file is one which is a dependency but is not built by Shake as it has no
        --   matching rule and already exists on the file system.
    | ChangeModtimeOrDigest
        -- ^ A file is rebuilt if either its modification time or its digest has changed. A @touch@ will force a rebuild,
        --   but even if a files modification time is reset afterwards, changes will also cause a rebuild.

data ShakeOptions = ShakeOptions
    {shakeFiles :: FilePath
        -- ^ Defaults to @.shake@. The directory used for storing Shake metadata files.
        --   All metadata files will be named @'shakeFiles'\/.shake./file-name/@, for some @/file-name/@.
        --   If the 'shakeFiles' directory does not exist it will be created.
        --   If set to @\"\/dev\/null\"@ then no shakeFiles are read or written (even on Windows).
    ,shakeThreads :: Int
        -- ^ Defaults to @1@. Maximum number of rules to run in parallel, similar to @make --jobs=/N/@.
        --   For many build systems, a number equal to or slightly less than the number of physical processors
        --   works well. Use @0@ to match the detected number of processors (when @0@, 'getShakeOptions' will
        --   return the number of threads used).
    ,shakeVersion :: String
        -- ^ Defaults to @"1"@. The version number of your build rules.
        --   Change the version number to force a complete rebuild, such as when making
        --   significant changes to the rules that require a wipe. The version number should be
        --   set in the source code, and not passed on the command line.
    ,shakeVerbosity :: Verbosity
        -- ^ Defaults to 'Info'. What level of messages should be printed out.
    ,shakeStaunch :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'False'. Operate in staunch mode, where building continues even after errors,
        --   similar to @make --keep-going@.
    ,shakeReport :: [FilePath]
        -- ^ Defaults to @[]@. Write a profiling report to a file, showing which rules rebuilt,
        --   why, and how much time they took. Useful for improving the speed of your build systems.
        --   If the file extension is @.json@ it will write JSON data; if @.js@ it will write Javascript;
        --   if @.trace@ it will write trace events (load into @about:\/\/tracing@ in Chrome);
        --   otherwise it will write HTML.
    ,shakeLint :: Maybe Lint
        -- ^ Defaults to 'Nothing'. Perform sanity checks during building, see 'Lint' for details.
    ,shakeLintInside :: [FilePath]
        -- ^ Directories in which the files will be tracked by the linter.
    ,shakeLintIgnore :: [FilePattern]
        -- ^ File patterns which are ignored from linter tracking, a bit like calling 'Development.Shake.trackAllow' in every rule.
    ,shakeLintWatch :: [FilePattern]
        -- ^ File patterns whose modification causes an error. Raises an error even if 'shakeLint' is 'Nothing'.
    ,shakeCommandOptions :: [CmdOption]
        -- ^ Defaults to @[]@. Additional options to be passed to all command invocations.
    ,shakeFlush :: Maybe Seconds
        -- ^ Defaults to @'Just' 10@. How often to flush Shake metadata files in seconds, or 'Nothing' to never flush explicitly.
        --   It is possible that on abnormal termination (not Haskell exceptions) any rules that completed in the last
        --   'shakeFlush' seconds will be lost.
    ,shakeRebuild :: [(Rebuild, FilePattern)]
        -- ^ What to rebuild
    ,shakeAbbreviations :: [(String,String)]
        -- ^ Defaults to @[]@. A list of substrings that should be abbreviated in status messages, and their corresponding abbreviation.
        --   Commonly used to replace the long paths (e.g. @.make\/i586-linux-gcc\/output@) with an abbreviation (e.g. @$OUT@).
    ,shakeStorageLog :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'False'. Write a message to @'shakeFiles'\/.shake.storage.log@ whenever a storage event happens which may impact
        --   on the current stored progress. Examples include database version number changes, database compaction or corrupt files.
    ,shakeLineBuffering :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'True'. Change 'stdout' and 'stderr' to line buffering while running Shake.
    ,shakeTimings :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'False'. Print timing information for each stage at the end.
    ,shakeRunCommands :: Bool
        -- ^ Default to 'True'. Should you run command line actions, set to 'False' to skip actions whose output streams and exit code
        --   are not used. Useful for profiling the non-command portion of the build system.
    ,shakeChange :: Change
        -- ^ Default to 'ChangeModtime'. How to check if a file has changed, see 'Change' for details.
    ,shakeCreationCheck :: Bool
        -- ^ Default to 'True'. After running a rule to create a file, is it an error if the file does not exist.
        --   Provided for compatibility with @make@ and @ninja@ (which have ugly file creation semantics).
    ,shakeLiveFiles :: [FilePath]
        -- ^ Default to @[]@. After the build system completes, write a list of all files which were /live/ in that run,
        --   i.e. those which Shake checked were valid or rebuilt. Produces best answers if nothing rebuilds.
    ,shakeVersionIgnore :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'False'. Ignore any differences in 'shakeVersion'.
    ,shakeColor :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'False'. Whether to colorize the output.
    ,shakeShare :: Maybe FilePath
        -- ^ Defaults to 'Nothing'. Whether to use and store outputs in a shared directory.
    ,shakeCloud :: [String]
        -- ^ Defaults to @[]@. Cloud servers to talk to forming a shared cache.
    ,shakeSymlink :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to @False@. Use symlinks for 'shakeShare' if they are available.
        --   If this setting is @True@ (even if symlinks are not available) then files will be
        --   made read-only to avoid inadvertantly poisoning the shared cache.
        --   Note the links are actually hard links, not symlinks.
    ,shakeNeedDirectory :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to @False@. Is depending on a directory an error (default), or it is permitted with
        --   undefined results. Provided for compatibility with @ninja@.
    ,shakeAllowRedefineRules :: Bool
        -- ^ Whether to allow calling addBuiltinRule for the same key more than once
    ,shakeWatch :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to @False@. Whether to watch for file changes and rebuild.
    ,shakeProgress :: IO Progress -> IO ()
        -- ^ Defaults to no action. A function called when the build starts, allowing progress to be reported.
        --   The function is called on a separate thread, and that thread is killed when the build completes.
        --   For applications that want to display progress messages, 'progressSimple' is often sufficient, but more advanced
        --   users should look at the 'Progress' data type.
    ,shakeOutput :: Verbosity -> String -> IO ()
        -- ^ Defaults to writing using 'putStrLn'. A function called to output messages from Shake, along with the 'Verbosity' at
        --   which that message should be printed. This function will be called atomically from all other 'shakeOutput' functions.
        --   The 'Verbosity' will always be greater than or higher than 'shakeVerbosity'.
    ,shakeTrace :: String -> String -> Bool -> IO ()
        -- ^ Defaults to doing nothing.
        --   Called for each call of 'Development.Shake.traced', with the key, the command and 'True' for starting, 'False' for stopping.
    ,shakeExtra :: Map.HashMap TypeRep Dynamic
        -- ^ This a map which can be used to store arbitrary extra information that a user may need when writing rules.
        --   The key of each entry must be the 'dynTypeRep' of the value.
        --   Insert values using 'addShakeExtra' and retrieve them using 'getShakeExtra'.
        --   The correct way to use this field is to define a hidden newtype for the key, so that conflicts cannot occur.
