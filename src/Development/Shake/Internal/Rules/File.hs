-- | Add a dependency on the file arguments, ensuring they are built before continuing.
--   The file arguments may be built in parallel, in any order. This function is particularly
--   necessary when calling 'Development.Shake.cmd' or 'Development.Shake.command'. As an example:
--
-- @
-- \"\/\/*.rot13\" '%>' \\out -> do

--     'Development.Shake.cmd' \"rot13\" [src] \"-o\" [out]
-- @
--
--   Usually @need [foo,bar]@ is preferable to @need [foo] >> need [bar]@ as the former allows greater
--   parallelism, while the latter requires @foo@ to finish building before starting to build @bar@.
--
--   This function should not be called with wildcards (e.g. @*.txt@ - use 'getDirectoryFiles' to expand them),
--   environment variables (e.g. @$HOME@ - use 'getEnv' to expand them) or directories (directories cannot be
--   tracked directly - track files within the directory instead).

-- | Declare a Make-style phony action.  A phony target does not name

--   although that's not recommended.)
--
--   Phony actions are intended to define recipes that can be executed
--   by the user. If you 'need' a phony action in a rule then every
--   execution where that rule is required will rerun both the rule and
--   the phony action.  However, note that phony actions are never
--   executed more than once in a single build run.
--
--   In make, the @.PHONY@ attribute on non-file-producing rules has a
--   similar effect.  However, while in make it is acceptable to omit
--   the @.PHONY@ attribute as long as you don't create the file in
--   question, a Shake rule which behaves this way will fail lint.
