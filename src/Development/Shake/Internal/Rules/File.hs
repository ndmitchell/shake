-- | Add a dependency on the file arguments, ensuring they are built before continuing.
--   The file arguments may be built in parallel, in any order. This function is particularly
--   necessary when calling 'Development.Shake.cmd' or 'Development.Shake.command'. As an example:
--
-- @
-- \"\/\/*.rot13\" '%>' \\out -> do

--     'need' [src]
--     'Development.Shake.cmd' \"rot13\" [src] \"-o\" [out]
-- @
--
--   Usually @need [foo,bar]@ is preferable to @need [foo] >> need [bar]@ as the former allows greater
--   parallelism, while the latter requires @foo@ to finish building before starting to build @bar@.
--
--   This function should not be called with wildcards (e.g. @*.txt@ - use 'getDirectoryFiles' to expand them),
--   environment variables (e.g. @$HOME@ - use 'getEnv' to expand them) or directories (directories cannot be

--
--   In make, the @.PHONY@ attribute on non-file-producing rules has a
--   similar effect.  However, while in make it is acceptable to omit
--   the @.PHONY@ attribute as long as you don't create the file in
